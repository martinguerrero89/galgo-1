\title{Distance to centroid classifier}
\usage{
classify(data, centroid, method = "pearson")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a \code{data.frame} of dimensions \eqn{n x p} with the samples to classify, were \eqn{n} are the same set of features as in the centroids}

\item{centroid}{a \code{data.frame} of dimensions \eqn{n x m}, where each column is a prototypic centroid to classify the samples}

\item{method}{Character string indicating which method to use to calculate distance to centroid. Options are \code{"pearson"} (default), \code{"kendall"}, or \code{"spearman"}}
}
\value{
Returns a numeric vector of length \eqn{p} with the class assigned to each sample according to the shortest distance to centroid
}
\description{
Given an \eqn{n x m} matrix of centroids, where \eqn{m} are the prototypic centroids with \eqn{n} features, classify new samples according to the distance to the centroids.

\examples{
rna_luad<-use_rna_luad()
library(Biobase)

#The expression of the toy datasets are already scaled
prm <- exprs(rna_luad$TCGA)

#We change the rownames to be gene Symbol insted of Gene Id.
rownames(prm)<- fData(rna_luad$TCGA)$gene

#Wilkerson's centroids
centroids<- rna_luad$WilkCentroids

#Extract features from both data.frames
inBoth<- Reduce(intersect, list(rownames(prm),rownames(centroids)))

#Classify samples
Wilk.Class<- classify(prm[inBoth,],centroids[inBoth,])
table(Wilk.Class)
