\title{cosine similarity}
\usage{
cosine(a, b)
}
\arguments{
\item{a, b}{A string of numbers with equal length. It can also be two binary strings of 0's and 1's}
}
\value{
In practice, the function can return numeric values from -1 to 1 according the vector orientations, where a cosine similarity of 1 implies same orientation of the vectors while -1 imply vector of oposing directions. In the binary application, values range from 0 to 1, where 0 are totally discordant vectors while 1 are identical binary vectors.
}
\description{
Cosine similarity is a metric of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them.
Two vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity of 1, if they are perpendicular they have a similarity of 0, and if they have oposing directions the cosine similarity is -1, independent of their magnitude.
One advantage of cosine similarity is its low-complexity, especially for sparse vectors where only the non-zero dimensions need to be considered, which is a common case in \code{galgoR}.
Other names of cosine similarity are Otuska-Orchini similarity when it is applied to binary data, which is the case for \code{galgoR}, where individual solutions represented as strings of 0 and 1 are compared with this metric.

\examples{
solution1= c(1,0,0,1,0,0,1)
solution2= solution1
r=cosine(solution1, solution2)
#the cosine similarity (r) equals 1
solution2= abs(solution1-1)
r2=cosine(solution1, solution2)
#the cosine similarity (r2) equals 0
